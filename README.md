creating my own personal website
hello! I am Azra and this is my personal website! It is meant to showcase like hobbies and interests. I wanted to make this project to learn HTML/CSS and a long the way I learned a little bit of javascript! I made my project by learning the basics of html and css and applying my knowledge. I was able to learn how to make an image carousel (this took me a LONG time) as well as a flipbook (also took a long time) but I am really happy with how this turned out! I struggled a lot especially with debugging because since I was still learning how to code it was much harder for me to catch any mistakes that I made. The image carousel and the radio buttons really look me a long time to figure out but when I figured it out, it was so satisfying! Something that I thought would be really simple was the navbar drop down (but that took me a few hours T-T) but I am really glad with how everything turned out :). Below I attached an image for a preview of my website!
